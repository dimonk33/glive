This example program shows how to use the Gstreamer library to 
create an RTSP video streamer on i.MX6 boards, though it 
could easily be used on other platforms by changing the
launch string.

The program is licensed with the GNU Public License, version 2.

Hardware Dependencies:
Server:
  Freescale i.MX6-based board
  Image sensor connected to and working on CSI
Client:
  Any RTSP client program (e.g. VLC, gstreamer with rtspsrc)

Software Dependencies:
  Gstreamer-0.10 or Gstreamer1.0
  gst-fsl-plugins (mfw_v4lsrc, vpuenc)
  For x86 clients, it uses the ffdec_h264, ffmpegcolorspace, and
  autovideosink elements
  gst-rtsp-server

To build:

1) Make sure that a cross toolchain is configured in your path.

> export CROSS_COMPILE = <cross compiler prefix will end with a dash '-'>
> make

Copy the binaries to the target filesystem using your preferred method.
(e.g. ftp, scp, copying to SDcard)
  
Start server in RTSP mode:
> glive-server

then, open an RTSP client program and direct it to the correct URI:
http://<IP address>:8554/camera
